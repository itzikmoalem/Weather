# Weather
National-Weather

This program I used JS, Ajax, HTML, Json <br>
This program is weather that the user needs to input Name, Longitude and Latitude. all the inputs checked by validations, and if it's proper, the location added to dynamic list. <br>
The user get weather by click on item on the list (that has been added). the output is weather with date, temperature, icon and wind speed (by km/s).<br> this program contact with "http://www.7timer.info/doc.php?lang=en#graphical_api" server, and take the data by Json. I used namespace. <br>

Design: I designed the head picture (HAC weather), and create my own icons. <br>
